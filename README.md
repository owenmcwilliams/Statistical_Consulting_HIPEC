# Statistical_Consulting_HIPEC

This GitHub repository has the code required to obtain the results in our analysis of HIPEC. The code is included as .rmd file meaning it can be run in R, as long as you have access to the correct dataset which is stored within the LUMC. 

For any questions regarding the analysis contact: Owen via email (owenrm7@gmail.com) or Maja via email (maja.gledic28@gmail.com)
